# Ri-stagram  
## Ruby on Rails web app  

This was a weekend challenge during week 8 of [Makers](https://makers.tech/).

Steps to use this app:  

1. `git clone git@github.com:riannemcc/instagram-challenge.git`  
2. `Bundle install` (to install the required gems)  
3. `rails db:migrate`  

Ri-stagram allows you to sign up as a user (I used Devise for this) and then view either your own profile page or a posts feed which has the option to upload a post. A post can be commented on and also deleted.
